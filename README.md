# C64-title-loader
A program to load all of my C64 projects

Run with Vice.

Please do not boot an app from the .prg file in /build/ as it will result in a 'file not found' error. Instead use the .d64 included in the releases.


Note: Due to the way I have everything set up my commits will appear as commits by drskinner.
